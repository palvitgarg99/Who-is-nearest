# Who-is-nearest
"Who is nearest" is basically an android app,which aims at searching a person nearest to you,who also logged in at the same time.
It can serve as a basic module for various android apps..on little bit changing the code.
The basic working of OLA CABS,UBER CABS,JUGNOO AUTOS,EKO'S FUNDU project etc,is tried to be implemented in this app.
The app uses GCM(GOOGLE CLOUD MESSAGING SERVICES) at backend to provide the chatting functionality with the nearest person.
I have also uploaded the server code and apk file for the app.
The server is already online on some free hosting websites,you could try app by installing app on two mobiles parallely and login at the same time.
This app requires your location(high accuracy) and high internet speed.
While testing the app keep patience,bcoz the server is freely hosted,therefore speed is very slow.
